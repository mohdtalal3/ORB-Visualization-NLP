# ORB: Visualization Platform

## Description
ORB is a versatile visualization platform designed to facilitate dynamic exploration of data through interactive visual representations. Offering a range of visualization layouts such as icicle, chord, Tillford, Sugiyama, grid layout, and radial Sugiyama layout, it provides users with a user-friendly interface to interact with different visualization styles.

Additionally, ORB now integrates advanced natural language processing capabilities to introduce two innovative features: the Sentiment Network Graph and the Sentiment Dashboard.

The Sentiment Network Graph enables users to explore email interactions visually. It represents the connections between top senders and recipients, allowing users to dive into sentiment and emotion analysis within conversations.

The Sentiment Dashboard offers a streamlined approach to analyzing email conversations. Users can input sender and recipient email addresses to access sentiment analysis results. The dashboard presents extracted sentiments and associated keywords, enhancing users' understanding of the underlying emotions in their communications.
